🐍 **File-Serpent**

A simple Python utility to split and rejoin large files—ideal for transferring or storing data in parts.

📌 **Features**

Split any file into smaller chunks
Rejoin chunks to restore the original file
Lightweight and dependency-free

🛠️ **Requirements**

    Python 3.x

No external libraries required.

🚀 **How to Use**

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Saiyanav/File-Serpent.git
    cd File-Serpent

Run the splitter:

     python splitter.py

Run the joiner:

    python joiner.py

You will be prompted for file paths and output names in the console.

🧠 **How It Works**

    splitter.py: Reads the source file and breaks it into equal-sized parts.

    joiner.py: Reads all parts and reconstructs the original file.
